Day 9 of the 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (Cohort S)
As we progress deeper into the quantum realm, todayâ€™s focus was on the foundational constructs of Quantum Mechanicsâ€”the very framework upon which modern quantum computing is built.
ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Explored:
Fundamental Quantum Gates: Pauli-X, Y, Z operations
Hadamard Transformations for creating superpositions
Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate for entanglement
Unitary Transformations & State Evolutions
These principles form the backbone of quantum computation, helping us understand qubit behavior, interactions, and the evolution of quantum states. Mastering them lays the groundwork for designing and scaling powerful quantum computational models.

🌟 Day 11 of the QuCode 21 Days Quantum Computing Challenge – Cohort 3! 🌟

Today, I explored one of the most mind-bending phenomena in quantum mechanics — Quantum Entanglement. It’s the mysterious connection where qubits become correlated in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter the distance.

🔍 Today’s Focus:

Bell States

EPR Paradox

Non-locality

📚 Learning Resources:

Entanglement Basics – Veritasium

EPR Paradox – MinutePhysics

✅ Key Takeaways:

Bell States:
The simplest examples of maximally entangled two-qubit states, forming the foundation of quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography.

EPR Paradox:
Proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen — questioning whether quantum mechanics is complete and highlighting the “spooky action at a distance.”

Non-locality:
Experiments show that entangled particles exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics, confirming quantum mechanics’ strange but real predictions.

💡 What really clicked today:
Entanglement is not just weird theory — it’s a resource. From quantum teleportation to secure communication, it’s the backbone of the quantum technologies we’re building today.

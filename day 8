Day 8 of the 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge with QuCode
ðŸ’¡ Todayâ€™s Learnings: Single-qubit states & Quantum state visualization
Single-qubit gates are the fundamental building blocks of hashtag#QuantumComputing. They act on a single qubit, modifying its hashtag#QuantumState, often through rotations on the Bloch sphere.
âœ¨ Key examples:
Pauli gates (X, Y, Z): Similar to classical NOT gates but with unique quantum phase effects.
Hadamard gate (H): Creates superposition states by moving a qubit to an equatorial position.
Phase gates (S, T): Introduce controlled phase shifts to the state.
ðŸ”„ For instance:
The X-gate (NOT) flips |0âŸ© to |1âŸ©, moving the state to the opposite pole.
The H-gate (Hadamard) transforms |0âŸ© into a balanced superposition of |0âŸ© and |1âŸ©.

Today's 7 fotus: 21-Pays Quantum Challenge with #@ucode Pay of the Schrödlinger Equation, Measurement, and the Postulates of Quantum Mechanics.
*t We learned that the Schrödinger equation isn't pulled out of thin air, it arises from the time evolution of a unitary operator.
The mysterious "isn't just decoration; fe's what guarantees probability conservation.
○ The tamiltonian steps in as the generator of time volution, linking the math to the physical idea of energy. ○ And the best part? The wavefunction remains perfectly normalized as it flows through time.
MInthe live session, We also dove into some practical aspects: Basic @iskit implementation A look at hardware execution And some really fun demonstrations of quantum games like Quantum Chess, @uantum Ladder, and Quantum Sudoku.
It's exciting to see both the theory and playful applications t f quantum mechanics coming together.

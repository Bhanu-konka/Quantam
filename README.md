Day 2 of 21 – Quantum Computing Challenge (QuCode)

Today was all about Probability Theory & Statistics – the invisible framework holding quantum mechanics together.

📒 Key Takeaways from Day 2

Probability isn’t just coin flips – it’s the foundation for predicting quantum outcomes.

Distributions give us the “shape” of uncertainty, helping model how quantum states behave.

Bayes’ Theorem is a game-changer – updating our beliefs as we observe new information (perfectly aligned with how measurements collapse quantum states!).

💡 Biggest Insight
Quantum mechanics doesn’t give us certainty, only probabilities. To understand qubits, we need to be comfortable living in a world where probability, not determinism, rules.

Feeling my brain stretch in new directions – but that’s the fun of it. Excited to dive into Day 3!
